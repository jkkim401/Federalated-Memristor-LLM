Other 10pt ROS reviewed and otherwise negative. . In the ED, pt received 5mg IV morphine x 2 with cipro and  flagyl. Pt evaluated by surgery. Pt underwent ultrasound.     Past Medical History: Per OMR ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: - ___: Presented emergently to ___ with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and aspiration pneumonia, all of which had been escalating over the course of a week prior to his presentation and preceded by an unintentional weight loss of about ___ pounds over the prior couple of weeks. CT scan showed a distended stomach with thickening of the gastric antrum, but  no evidence of distant metastases and no radiographic evidence of local regional lymphadenopathy.  Upper endoscopy reportedly showed a mass in the gastric antrum biopsy which reportedly confirmed adenocarcinoma.   - ___: Taken to the operating room at ___ with surgeon Dr. ___ and underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction.  Intraoperatively, Dr. ___ describes no visible evidence of peritoneal metastases. There was apparently note made of a ""nodule"" within the resected part of the stomach that was separate from the tumor itself.  By the outside hospital pathology report, the gastric tumor  specimen showed a 5.5 cm intestinal type, poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma invading into the subserosal connective tissue (pT3).  Surgical margins are described as negative, however, per the pathology note ""a small focus of intermixed crushed epithelial cells with associated inflammation"" is seen in the perigastric fat on one of the shaved distal margin permanent sections (slide ___.  Most of these cells are bland, but a  few atypical cells are seen.  Overall, they morphologically appeared dissimilar to the high-grade cytology seen in the poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma, but the crushed nature of this focus makes interpretation difficult.  These cells were not seen on the corresponding intraoperative frozen section slide  and are not seen on deeper levels.  The significance of this focus  is unclear, but the possibility that this focus represents adenocarcinoma at the distal margin is not favored.  The slide with this focus was reviewed interdepartmentally.""  There was lymphovascular invasion. Five out of 17 lymph nodes were  involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma (pN2).  The ""gastric nodule"" was found to be 0.55 cm gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with 1 mitosis per 20 high-powered fields, which was focally present at a cauterized specimen margin.  Per the outside hospital  pathology report, HER-2/neu expression was negative by  immunohistochemistry and non amplified by FISH analysis (ratio of 1.2).  - ___: Began cycle 1 of adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin (50 mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (60 mg/m2 on day 1), and capecitabine (1000 mg PO q12h on days ___ on 21-day cycles - ___: Began adjuvant chemoradiation with capecitabine 1000 mg PO BID as a radiosensitizer.

In ___, he had recurrence of a  cutaneous eruption involving the right cheek, but evaluation was  felt inconsistent with recurrent herpes zoster and biopsies  supported a clonal low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferation, perhaps  ""marginal zone B-cell lymphoma,"" reviewed by dermatologist Dr.  ___ at ___.  (2) This right face cutaneous eruption waxed and waned in early  ___, extending to involve the right nostril and skin to the  left of midline underneath the nose. In follow-up evaluation a  CBC showed leukocytosis (WBC = 22.7K), but differential was not  obtained. He saw Dr. ___ in follow-up who performed skin  lesional punch biopsy of the superior nasolabial crease on  ___. This showed skin involvement by CLL, without evidence of  transformation.  (3) Subsequently, he saw Dr. ___ at ___, and flow  cytometry of peripheral blood on ___ confirmed a lymphocyte  predominance by CLL; 3% of cells were positive for CD38. On  ___, torso CT scan at ___ showed extensive lymphadenopathy  at multiple sites throughout the upper neck, chest, abdomen and  pelvis, as summarized in my ___ note.  (4) Repeat CBCs in ___ again showed leukocytosis with  lymphocyte predominance on differential. He saw hematologist Dr. ___ for a second opinion. At ___, WBCs = 13.6 and 17.9K with 76% and 66% lymphocytes on ___ and ___, respectively. Flow cytometry at ___ again confirmed CLL; however, 50% of B cells were CD38 positive. (5) In ___, he developed fevers and constitutional symptoms  with marked fatigue and weight loss. On evaluation by Dr. ___  ___ at ___, concern was raised regarding transformation of his CLL, and repeat torso CT scan was obtained on ___, showing interval increase in some but not all areas of lymphadenopathy, as summarized in my ___ note. However, subsequent evaluation by infectious disease specialist Dr. ___ at ___ disclosed erlichiosis, and therapy with doxycycline was begun.  By ___, he had noted marked improvement in his constitutional symptoms with resolution of fevers and stabilization of his weight, having had a 15-pound weight loss during his ___ illness.  (6) In ___, he developed bilateral otitis media, worse on the right, complicated by tympanic membrane perforation. Throughtout ___ and ___ he noted progressive DOE. He saw Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ who noted 2 cm submandibular and inguinal lymph nodes, in addition to small anterior and  posterior cervical and bilateral axillary lymph nodes. Chest exam was clear. WBC was now 60K, representing a tripling in WBC over 4 months. Peripheral blood FISH analysis on CLL cells was obtained showing abnormalities for the D13S319 13q14.3 and P53 17p13.1 probes in ___ and 70/100 nuclei, respectively.  (7) In ___, he met pulmonologist Dr. ___ and cardiologist Dr. ___, who diagnosed and managed CHF. On lasix, he felt improved shortness of breath. However, on ___ and ___ he experienced ""crashing"" fevers and sweats. With progressive dyspnea, he was found to have markedly increased  left pleural effusion and posterior pericardial effusion with RV collapse. Admitted to hospital on ___, he ultimately underwent placement of a pericardial window, with drainage of left pleural and pericardial fluid, both showing CLL cells. However, evaluation of pericardial tissue showed organizing fibrinous material with entrapped mixed inflammatory cells, including numerous small lymphocytes consistent with CLL cells. However, there was no evidence of Richter's transformation or otherwise, and CLL cells were regarded as ""bystanders."" The overall findings were those of an ""organizing pericarditis, the cause of which is unclear."" Of note, multiple specimens for various infectious diseases (see OMR) were negative except for ___ B4 and B5 antibodies which were ""8"" rather than ""less than 8."" (8) On ___, he was admitted to hospital from ___ to ___ with progressive dyspnea related to worsening bilateral pleural effusions. Left thorascopic pleural biospy and talc pleurodesis were performed on ___. Pleural biopsy showed: ""Extensive granulation tissue along with mesothelial proliferation and hemosiderin-laden macrophages are seen, consistent with the chronicity of the effusive process is present.  No morphological evidence of large cell transformation or infection is seen.  The morphology, supported by the concurrent flow cytometry immunophenotyping ___: CD20 dim, CD5-positive, CD23-positive, lambda light chain expression) is consistent with a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma."" Again, CLL was felt to be a ""bystander"" and not the cause of the pleural effusion. Of note, convalescent serum samples subsequently returned showing a rise in ___ B5 antibody to a level of 32. Molecular analyses for Erlichia were negative on pleural tissue. He felt improved after talc pleurodesis. (9) With progressive symptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia, he began his first chemotherapy for CLL on ___, receiving  cycle #1 of fludarabine/Cytoxan (without rituximab). On ___, when peripheral blood lymphocytes declined below 50K, he received his first dose of Rituxin, given over 2 days. Further therapy with Fludara/Cytoxan was held due to persistent thrombocytopenia. On ___, with persistent thrombocytopenia, he began weekly Rituxin X 4 with vincristine and prednisone 100 mg daily x5  added to Rituxin on ___, followed by prednisone taper for presumed ITP. With subsequent improvement in platelet counts, he received R-CVP from ___ to ___. On ___, with substantial recovery in all blood counts, he received FCR, with FC administered on days 1 and 2, not day 3. Full-dose cycle ___ FCR was administered on days 1 through 3 beginning ___. (10)Due to worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia thought to be secondary to ITP as well as bone marrow involvement with CLL, he received a pulse of high-dose dexamethasone at the beginning of ___ with 4 doses of weekly rituximab and weekly vincristine on weeks 2 through 4 ___ through ___. On ___, he began daily prednisone instead of dexamethasone pulsing. Thrombocytopenia improved but anemia persisted. (11) On ___, he began Campath subcutaneously in an attempt to further unload CLL from bone marrow. On ___, after five Campath doses, Campath was held secondary to WBC 0.4 with ANC  297 and increased anemia and thrombocytopenia. He received one week of weekly rituximab on ___. (12) Hospitalized ___ to ___ with febrile neutropenia attributed to viral infection. Blood cultures, urine culture,  CMV viral load, adenovirus PCR, EBV PCR, Parvo 19 DNA negative and HHV-8 PCR and respiratory viral screen and cultures were all negative. Received Cefime and  Neupogen with resolution of fever. (13) On ___, with worsened severe thrombocytopenia  attributed to ITP complicating progressive CLL, he resumed prednisone 1 mg/kg = 80 mg daily. 14) From ___ to ___, he recieved cycle 1 cyclophosphamide plus 7 days dexamethasone (in lieu of prednisone). Cycle 1 was complicated by H1N1 infection with presumed superimposed aspergillosis, and he was in hospital with prolonged  neutropenia. With persistent neutropenia, he received 4 weekly doses of rituximab in ___ and again in ___, ending on ___. Prednisone was resumed for ITP following hi-dose pulsed dexamethasone, and prednisone dosing has been tapered slowly. On ___, we administered IVIg for hypogammaglobulinemia in the setting of his infection. On ___, repeat chest CT showed marked improvement with near complete resolution of ground glass lung opacities, prompting infectious disease specialist Dr. ___ to discontinue voriconazole therapy for aspergillosis. (15) Began RCD chemotherapy on ___ for progressive thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphadenopathy and neutropenia. (16) After four cycles of RCD chemotherapy, anemia and thrombocytopenia improved, and lymphadenopathy resolved.
